# Tech stack

## Drivers

The tech stack is opinionated. The drivers for such a tech stack are:

- Cross-platform (Windows, Linux, Mac, Android, iOS). We will also support WASM for browser-based applications and to enable edge-compute.
- Robust decoupling of backend and frontend - to enable reusable components
- .NET-based - well, that's why we have this project in the first place :-)
- Open source with permissive license - so it can simply be adapted for your needs

## Stack

- .NET (we will strive to be at the latest versions)
- Uno platform for cross-platform development, because of its versatility in supporting all platforms of our interest.
- XAML + MVUX as code and architectural patterns
- OpenAI / Ollama / something similar - APIs at the backend
